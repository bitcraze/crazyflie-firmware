The Deck API allows to easily communicates with decks installed on the
Crazyflie.

If you want to get started you can follow the
[howto](/docs/development/howto.md) to get your code
running.

Deck drivers
------------

Decks are enumerated automatically using a modular discovery system that supports multiple backends:

- **OneWire backend**: Reads deck information from One Wire (OW) memory soldered on the deck PCB
- **DeckCtrl backend**: I2C-based intelligent discovery using deck controller microcontrollers
- **Forced backend**: Allows compile-time forcing of deck drivers via `CONFIG_DECK_FORCE` (for development)

The architecture is extensible: New discovery backends can be added for different communication protocols. Each backend is called sequentially during system initialization to discover all connected decks.

### Discovery backend configuration

Backends can be enabled or disabled via KConfig options:
- `CONFIG_DECK_BACKEND_ONEWIRE` - Enable OneWire backend (typically always enabled)
- `CONFIG_DECK_BACKEND_DECKCTRL` - Enable DeckCtrl backend
- `CONFIG_DECK_BACKEND_DECKCTRL_MAX_DECKS` - Maximum number of DeckCtrl decks to enumerate (default varies by platform)

Discovery runs at startup in the order backends are registered. All enabled backends are queried to build the complete list of connected decks.

The Deck driver API uses a declarative syntax to register deck drivers and initialize them when the proper deck is detected through any of the discovery backends.

### Minimal driver

This is a minimal deck driver, myled.c:

``` {.c}
#include "deck.h"

void myledInit(DeckInfo *info)
{
  pinMode(DECK_GPIO_IO1, OUTPUT);     // Set my Led pin to output
  digitalWrite(DECK_GPIO_IO1, HIGH);  // Light it up
}

bool myledTest()
{
  return true;
}

const DeckDriver myled_driver = {
  .vid = 0,
  .pid = 0,
  .name = "meMyled",


  .usedGpio = DECK_USING_IO_1,

  .init = myledInit,
  .test = myledTest,
};

DECK_DRIVER(myled_driver);
```

-   At startup the decks are enumerated and if a deck has the name
    \"meMyled\", it will be initialized.
-   Init is called on all initialized driver and then test is called.
-   The init and test functions are both optional (we have some board
    with only init and event some with only test). If absent just remove
    the *.init* or *.test* initialization.
-   In this mode no task are created so to run some code at regular
    intervale the code needs to deal with freeRtos or with the other
    parts of the Crazyflie code.

To compile the driver, place it in deck/drivers/src/ and add it to the
Kbuild file:

``` {.make}
obj-y += myled.o
```

### Forcing initialization of a driver

The deck driver will be initialized only if a deck is connected with the
right OW memory content or other discovery method detects it. During development 
it is possible to force the initialization of one or more decks by setting the 
`CONFIG_DECK_FORCE` config option in your `.config` either by hand or using `make menuconfig`:

- Single deck: `CONFIG_DECK_FORCE="meMyled"`
- Multiple decks: `CONFIG_DECK_FORCE="meMyled:anotherDeck"`

### Driver declaration API

*DECK\_DRIVER(const struct DeckDriver)*

To register a deck driver the DECK\_DRIVER() macro should be called with
a deck structure as argument.

#### DeckDriver structure

``` {.c}
typedef struct deck_driver {
  /* Identification of the deck (written in the board) */
  uint8_t vid;
  uint8_t pid;
  char *name;

  /*
   * Peripheral and Gpio used _directly_ by the driver.
   *
   * Include the pin in usedGpio if it's used directly by the driver, do not
   * add the pin to usedGpio if it used as part of a peripheral.
   *
   * For example: If a deck driver uses SPI we add DECK_USING_SPI to
   * usedPeriph. If the deck uses the MOSI, MISO or SCK pins for other stuff
   * than SPI it would have to specify DECK_USING_[PA7|PA6|PA5].
   *
   */
  uint32_t usedPeriph;
  uint32_t usedGpio;

  /* Required system properties */
  StateEstimatorType requiredEstimator;
  bool requiredKalmanEstimatorAttitudeReversionOff;
  bool requiredLowInterferenceRadioMode;

  // Deck memory access definitions
  const struct deckMemDef_s* memoryDef;

  // Have an option to present a secondary memory area for instance for decks
  // two firmwares.
  const struct deckMemDef_s* memoryDefSecondary;

  /* Init and test functions */
  void (*init)(struct deckInfo_s *);
  bool (*test)(void);
} DeckDriver;
```
