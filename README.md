# Crazyflie Firmware  [![CI](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

This project contains the source code for the firmware used in the Crazyflie range of platforms, including the Crazyflie 2.x and the Roadrunner.

### Crazyflie 1.0 support

The 2017.06 release was the last release with Crazyflie 1.0 support. If you want
to play with the Crazyflie 1.0 and modify the code, please clone this repo and
branch off from the 2017.06 tag.

## Building and Flashing
See the [building and flashing instructions](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/blob/master/docs/building-and-flashing/build.md) in the github docs folder.


This specific branch contains modifications for the Umwelt project, aiming at using a Crazyflie and the Lighthouse to
track human motion.
The intention is that the changes in this branch will be done at a high pace of development and experimentation, and
should be considered closer to a POC than production code. Useful stuff will possibly be moved to master at a later
stage.


NOTE: To get started and build the code use the "umwelt_defconfig".

1. Clone the project `git clone --recursive https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware.git`
2. Initialize the config `make umwelt_defconfig`
3. Build it `make`
