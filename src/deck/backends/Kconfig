    help
      Enable debug prints for the deck controller subsystem.
      This will output additional information about deck detection,
      initialization, and communication for debugging purposes.

config DECKCTRL_MAX_DECKS
    int "Maximum number of DECKCTRL decks supported"
    range 1 12
    default 4
    help
      Set the maximum number of DECKCTRL decks that can be connected simultaneously.
      This limits the number of decks that can be enumerated and managed by the system.
      Increasing this number will increase RAM usage.
