    help
      The Active marker deck together with Qualisys QTM gives you long
      distance and solid tracking. Thanks to the 4 high-power LEDs you
      can set up to 4 different IDs giving you the possibility to uniqly
      identify a large number of rigid bodies, without the need of many
      reflective markers.

      The AI-deck 1.1 extends the computational capabilities and will
      enable complex artificial intelligence-based workloads to run
      onboard, with the possibility to achieve fully autonomous
      navigation capabilities. The ESP32 adds WiFi connectivity with
      the possibility to stream images as well as handling control.

    help
      With the BigQuad deck you can transform your Crazyflie 2.X to a
      bigger quad by connecting external Electronic speed controllers
      (ESCs) to the breakout connectors on the deck. The autodetection
      of the deck makes this transformation possible to do in seconds.
      The deck also contains breakout header connectors for additional
      accessories such as external receiver (CPPM input) and GPS.
      It can also monitor battery voltage and current.

      Sometimes LED feedback isn’t enough, like when you’re flying
      around in a lab and living room. With the Buzzer deck you’ll get
      audio feedback on system events, like low battery or charging
      completed. Or why not create your own melodies that will play
      while you’re buzzing around. If you’re tapped out on creativity
      there are already a few melodies pre-programmed that you can use.

      The Flow deck gives the Crazyflie 2.X the ability to understand
      when it’s moving in any direction. The VL53L1x ToF sensor measures
      the distance to the ground with high precision and the PMW3901
      optical flow sensor measures movements in relation to the ground.
      This creates a flying 3D robot that can be pre-programmed to fly
      distances in any direction or act as an aid for beginners where
      it creates a very stable flying platform.

      With Crazyflie and the Lighthouse positioning deck, high precision
      autonomous flight becomes available for everyone. The Lighthouse
      deck uses the HTC Vive base stations (aka Lighthouse V1) or
      SteamVR Base Station 2.0 (aka Lighthouse V2) to achieve high
      precision positioning. The deck has 4 receivers which gives the
      full pose of the Crazyflie.

      The Loco Positioning deck  is a Tag in a Loco Positioning system
      and measures the distances to Anchors. The distances are used to
      estimate the absolute position of the Crazyflie 2.X in the room,
      which can be used for autonomous flight. The position is calculated
      on-board of the Crazyflie and there is no need for an external
      computer for position estimation.

      The Micro SD card deck adds a Micro SD card reader to the Crazyflie

      The standard firmware has support for high speed logging (up to 1 kHz)
      to the SD-card which can record data at rates that are higher than
      what can be transfered via radio in real time. When the recoding
      is finished the SD-card can be moved to a computer for data analyses.
      It is also possible to access the file system from applications

      the use of files.
