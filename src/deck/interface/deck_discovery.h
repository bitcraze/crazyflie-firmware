 * @brief Deck discovery backend interface
 *
 * This interface defines how deck discovery backends work. Each backend
 * is responsible for discovering decks using a specific protocol or mechanism
 * (e.g., OneWire memory, I2C enumeration, compile-time forcing).
 *
 * Backends are registered using the DECK_DISCOVERY_BACKEND() macro and are
 * called sequentially during system initialization. Each backend's init()
 * function is called once, followed by repeated calls to getNextDeck() until
 * it returns NULL to indicate no more decks are available.
 *
 * Multiple backends can coexist, allowing discovery of different deck types
 * (e.g., legacy OneWire decks and new DeckCtrl decks) in a single system.
