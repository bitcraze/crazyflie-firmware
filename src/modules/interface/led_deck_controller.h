 * led_deck_controller.h - Generic LED Deck Controller
 *
 * Provides a unified interface for controlling LED decks through a generic
 * parameter namespace, abstracting hardware differences between different
 * LED deck types.
 *
 * LED deck drivers register callback functions to receive color updates from this
 * controller. The controller provides a simple parameter interface for setting LED
 * colors.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   - LED decks call ledDeckRegisterHandler() during initialization
 *   - Users set led_deck_ctrl.* parameters to control LEDs
 *   - Last write wins: generic parameters and deck-specific parameters can
 *     be used interchangeably, with the most recent write taking effect
