/**
 *
 * The high level commander handles the setpoints from within the firmware
 * based on a predefined trajectory. This was merged as part of the
 * [Crazyswarm](%https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) project of the
 * [USC ACT lab](%https://act.usc.edu/) (see this
 * [blogpost](%https://www.bitcraze.io/2018/02/merging-crazyswarm-functionality-into-the-official-crazyflie-firmware/)).
 * The high-level commander uses a planner to generate smooth trajectories
 * based on actions like ‘take off’, ‘go to’ or ‘land’ with 7th order
 * polynomials. The planner generates a group of setpoints, which will be
 * handled by the High level commander and send one by one to the commander
 * framework.
 *
 * It is also possible to upload your own custom trajectory to the memory of
 * the Crazyflie, which you can try out with the script
 * `examples/autonomous_sequence_high_level of.py` in the Crazyflie python
 * library repository.
