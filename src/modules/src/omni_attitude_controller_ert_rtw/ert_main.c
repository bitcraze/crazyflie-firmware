 * Associating rt_OneStep with a real-time clock or interrupt service routine
 * is what makes the generated code "real-time".  The function rt_OneStep is
 * always associated with the base rate of the model.  Subrates are managed
 * by the base rate from inside the generated code.  Enabling/disabling
 * interrupts and floating point context switches are target specific.  This
 * example code indicates where these should take place relative to executing
 * the generated code step function.  Overrun behavior should be tailored to
 * your application needs.  This example simply sets an error status in the
 * real-time model and returns from rt_OneStep.
