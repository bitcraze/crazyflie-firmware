 */

/**
 * This driver assumes the ADC VREF is the same as the LV-MaxSonar-EZ4 VREF. This means
 * that the MB1040 Sensor should have its VCC pin connected to the VCC pin on the deck
 * port (instead of using the VCOM or VUSB pins).
 *
 * According to the datasheet for the MB1040, the sensor draws typically 2mA, so
 * powering it with the VCC pin (50mA max) on the deck port should be safe.
 *
 * See also https://forum.bitcraze.io/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1250
