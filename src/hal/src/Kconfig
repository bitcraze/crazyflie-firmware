config PM_BAT_LOW_VOLTAGE
    string "Low voltage threshold in volts"
    default 3.2
    help
        The power management subsystem will enter the "low voltage" state when
        the battery voltage is below this threshold for a prolonged period of
        time. The length of this period is configured in the code; see
        hal/interface/pm.h

config PM_BAT_CRITICAL_LOW_VOLTAGE
    string "Critical low voltage threshold in volts"
    default 3.0
    help
        The power management subsystem will shut the system down when the
        battery voltage is below this threshold for a prolonged period of
        time. The length of this period is configured in the code; see
        hal/interface/pm.h

config PM_DISABLE_CHARGER_DETECTION
    bool "Disable charger detection"
    default n
    help
        Use this setting on boards without a charger circuit that may
        incorrectly report that a charger is connected. Enabling this setting
        will force the firmware to assume that no charger is connected and the
        drone is not charging, even if the syslink info from the nRF51 chip
        tells otherwise.
