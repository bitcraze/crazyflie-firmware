/* A LED sequence is made of a list of actions. Each action contains the new
 * state of the LED and either a time to wait before executing the next action
 * or a command LOOP or STOP.
 *
 * The sequences are stored in a list by priority order ([0] is the highest
 * priority). The list ordered by priority is defined at the beginning of
 * ledseq.c
 *
 * Each sequence effects only one LED. For each LED only the runnable sequence
 * with the highest priority is run.
