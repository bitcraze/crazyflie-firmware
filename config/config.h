 * config.h - Main configuration file
 *
 * This file define the default configuration of the copter
 * It contains two types of parameters:
 * - The global parameters are globally defined and independent of any
 *   compilation profile. An example of such define could be some pinout.
 * - The profiled defines, they are parameter that can be specific to each
 *   dev build. The vanilla build is intended to be a "customer" build without
 *   fancy spinning debugging stuff. The developers build are anything the
 *   developer could need to debug and run his code/crazy stuff.
 *
 * The golden rule for the profile is NEVER BREAK ANOTHER PROFILE. When adding a
 * new parameter, one shall take care to modified everything necessary to
 * preserve the behavior of the other profiles.
 *
 * For the flag. T_ means task. H_ means HAL module. U_ would means utils.
