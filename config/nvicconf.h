 * nvicconf.c - Interrupt priority configuration
 *
 * The STM32 has 16 priorities to choose from where 0 is the
 * highest priority. They are now configured using no groups.

 * Interrupt functions that call FreeRTOS FromISR functions
 * must have a interrupt number 10 and above which is currently
