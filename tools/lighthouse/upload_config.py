#  Upload geometry and calibration data to the Crazyflie storage
#
#  This script reads geometry and calibration data from a system configuration
#  file, usually created from the client. The data is uploaded to a crazyflie and
#  written to the data to persistant memory to make it available after
#  re-boot.
#
#  This functionality can also be executed from the client, but this
#  script is handy when uploading configurations to a swarm for instance.
